		<p><br>My name is Robert Smith. I am eighteen years old. My
			sister is eight years old. I have a dog that is a golden retriever.
			His name is Tiger, and he is our only pet. I walk to school
			every day because my school is only three blocks away. It is
			located on Jones Street. Its address is 785 Jones Street. My
			address is 416 Meadow Avenue.
			<br><br>
			I live in a city that is beautiful and fascinating. We have many trees throughout the
			city and a big lake. I have two older sisters, but I am my Dad’s only son. My father
			is very proud of me. My mother is very athletic and intelligent. My father is tall and is
			a successful businessman. They are a handsome and attractive couple. We love to do
			things together. We are a very happy family.</p>
