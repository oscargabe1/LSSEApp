			<br>Susan and I are good friends. Yesterday we were at
			the local theater to see a new Broadway stage version of
			“Dracula.” The play was about a vampire in New York
			City, who fed on the blood of rich people. Susan and I are
			fans of vampire novels.
			<br><br>
			The play was quite scary and interesting. The costumes
			of the actors were very spectacular. The stage lighting and
			special effects were incredible. There were almost fifty
			actors in the play. We were really excited when we got an
			autograph from the leading actor. It was a lot of fun.</p>
