			<br>Allan is going to enroll in the university of New York.
				He was going to study engineering but he decided that the
				Arts is the best choice for him. Since he is the president of
				his senior class, he is going to give a speech on graduation
				day. They are going to have a ball and a local popular
				band is going to play that night.
			<br><br>
			All his classmates are going to continue their studies at the university. They are
			looking forward to a bright future and an exciting career. Some of them are going
			to study business; others are going to study medicine. Allan is going to Rome in a
			couple of weeks for an Art History course. The art history course is going to be about
			the architectural infrastructure of Rome. Allan is learning Italian and practicing his
			pronunciation. He is going to visit his friends and family because he is going to be out
			of town for quite a while.</p>
