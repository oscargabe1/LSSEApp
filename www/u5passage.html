			<br>This summer Sandy, Peter, Joe, and I are going on vacation to the mountains. We are planning to climb "The Needle" one of the highest mountains in the United States. It is a very steep and dangerous mountain that attracts a lot of tourists each year, but not all of them are going to climb to the top of it. Nine people already died trying to climb the mountain in past years. My friends and I were taking climbing lessons every weekend during the last year to be prepared for this moment. 
			<br><br>
			We will be taking pictures from the top of the mountains. Sunsets and sunrises from the top of the mountain are spectacular. Our group is made up of seven persons. One is our guise, two are world-class professional climbers and the rest of us, we are just people very fond of this sport. We are starting our trip tomorrow morning and we are hoping to make it to the top.</p>
