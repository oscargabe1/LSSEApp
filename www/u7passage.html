			<br>Paul and Miriam are twins. One day they both
				woke up sick with a high fever, so their mother
				didn’t let them go to school. It seemed that many
				children got the flu and were absent from school.
				The cold weather plus three days of rain helped
				the flu virus spread among the students. Since
				winter started, the teacher advised the students to
				cover themselves tightly before going outdoors.
				Their classmates were sad because they really
				missed Paul and Miriam. 
			<br><br>
			Paul’s best friend, Joshua, was happy because he wasn’t sick. He was even happier
			when he received his report card with straight A’s. Joshua’s parents were proud of their
			son, but were worried about his sister, Rosie. She fell from her bicycle and broke her arm
			while playing in the backyard. Her parents tried to cheer her up by renting some movies and
			making some popcorn. This was an interesting week for some of the students of Roosevelt’s
			Elementary School.</p>
