			<br>Tom works in an accounting firm. Hanna is
				his personal assistant. Tom studied to become an
				accountant; he is in charge of the major accounts
				of the firm, and of attending clients. Hanna is in
				charge of answering the telephone, taking messages,
				setting appointments with Tom’s clients, arranging
				staff meetings, taking minutes of such meetings and
				basically handling Tom’s personal agenda. Tom’s
				daily office duties are so many that without Hanna’s
				help he would be in a lot of trouble just by managing
				his daily activities. 
			<br><br>
			Among Tom’s duties are to assist clients in any request or doubt that they have
			concerning their accounts. Tom must know everything about their accounts and he needs
			to be up to date; so everyday he checks any changes or payments due in order for them to
			be corrected. If any mistakes were done on Tom’s behalf, he would not be happy because
			most of the mistakes in an accounting firm involve great amounts of money; in which
			the accountant is responsible for its proper handling. Also he is the one who takes care of
			paying dues on time; so that they won’t have any surcharges later on. Tom is really glad
			to have an assistant like Hanna; they make a great team working together.</p>
