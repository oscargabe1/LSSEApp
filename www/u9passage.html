			<br>The ability to communicate is a basic skill that one must master in order to succeed
			in life. We face many opportunities to communicate orally each day. It begins formally
			in elementary school where children are encouraged to participate in school plays.
			One may think that these opportunities are not important, that it’s just child’s play.
			But in reality, we learn to communicate through play. In school plays, children learn
			how to perform in front of people. 
			<br><br>
			In high school, teachers encourage children to
			write essays and read books, so we can expand
			our knowledge and form opinions. Developing
			good oral communication is important in the
			workplace. The ability to express ideas, and
			thoughts in a clear and precise manner is a
			positive attribute that is common among business
			leaders.<br><br>
			Being able to give orders, and manage human
			resources is made easier when one communicates
			well orally. Of course, oral communication is
			only part of effective communication.<br><br>
			The use of gestures, body language, and facial expressions are also part of effective
			communication, but oral communication is the part that solicits actions and reactions. So,
			remember next time you have to make a presentation in front of people, choose your
			words carefully, and relax, imagine you’re back in school performing in a school play.</p>
