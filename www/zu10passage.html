			The Braille system was invented by a Frenchman named Louis Braille in 1829. It is
			an alphabet consisting of an arrangement of raised dots, which can be read by blind
			people using their sense of touch. When Louis Braille was three years old, he accidentally
			plunged the knife into his eye, while he was cutting some leather in his father’s shop.
			After the accident he remained blind.
			<br><br>
			In 1819, when he was 10 years old, Louis Braille
			went to Paris on a scholarship to study at the National
			Institute for Blind Children. The institution’s founder hit
			on the idea of providing texts in the embossed Roman
			lettering which the blind could decipher. Two years after
			Louis had arrived at the institute, he was able to see a
			demonstration by Charles Barbier. This demonstration
			consisted of an apparatus, which could emboss a coded
			message of dots and dashes on cardboard. Louis enhanced
			this system and was able to adapt it to meet the needs of
			the blind. He published his work in 1829 and 1837.
			<br><br>
			Louis Braille became a dedicated teacher. He also became a talented organist, and it
			was through his life’s work that thousands of blind people have the ability to read.
