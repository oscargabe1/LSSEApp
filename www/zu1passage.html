		<p><br>His real name was Samuel Clemens, but everybody knew him as Mark Twain. Mark
		Twain was a famous American writer. Mark Twain was so famous in his days that there
		are many stories about him that have survived. Some of these stories may be true; others
		may be false. They are all very interesting. The following are two such stories:
			<br><br>
			Once Mark Twain wanted to borrow a certain book from a friend. The friend told
		him that he never permitted anyone to borrow any of his books from his personal
		library. If anyone wanted to use a book from his personal library, he must not remove
		it from it.
		<br><br>
		A few days later, this same friend wanted to
		borrow Mark Twain’s lawn mower in order to mow
		his lawn. Mark Twain then told him that he never
		permitted anyone to take his lawn mower from his
		yard. If the friend wanted to use the lawn mower, he
		must use it on Mark Twain’s own grass.
		<br><br>

		Here is yet another story of the famous Mark Twain:
		<br><br>
		One morning, when Mark Twain was dressing, he found that his shoes were covered
		with mud. He called his servant and said:
		<br><br>

		“My shoes are covered with mud. Why didn’t you clean them last night?” replied Mark
		Twain. “I thought it was useless to clean them in such bad weather, they will only get
		dirty again in a short time” the servant replied.
		<br><br>
		Later that day, when the servant came for his dinner, there was no food on the
		table for him. He went to Mark Twain and asked him why there was no food for him.
		“I thought it was useless for you to eat,” replied Mark Twain “because you will only get
		hungry again in a short time.”
