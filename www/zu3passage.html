			Many years ago, lived a farmer who wanted to be rich and own many acres of land.
			A stranger told him of some land for sale, nearby. The farmer bought the land. He was
			content for a while but then again, he wished to own even more land. The stranger
			told him of some additional land for sale. The farmer bought it again. This happened
			several times. The farmer bought more and more land but still was not satisfied.
			<br><br>
			One day, the stranger said that he had a
			friend some distance away. This friend could
			sell the farmer all the land he needed for only
			$300 dollars. The farmer went to visit the friend,
			whom he noticed, looked a lot like the stranger
			himself. The man said that for $300 dollars the
			farmer could have all the land he wanted. He
			could buy all the land he could walk on from
			sunrise to sunset. The farmer was supposed
			to walk as far as possible, mark the spot, and
			return before sunset. If he arrived late, he would
			lose both the land and the money.
			<br><br>
			The farmer agreed and went to bed that night in order to be well rested for his trip
			the next day. He did not sleep well. He dreamed that it was the devil himself who was
			tempting him. His greed for land was so great, however, that at sunrise he was dressed
			and ready to leave. He walked and ran all morning in order to cover as much ground
			as possible. On the return trip he was very tired. He walked slowly, and at the end he
			had to run a great distance in order to get back before sunset. When he arrived, he fell
			down exhausted. He died without ever getting up.
			<br><br>
			At the burial a few days later, the stranger had a smile on his face. The stranger
			remarked: “Now the old man has all the land he needs, exactly six feet in which to lie.
			I hope he’s satisfied.”
