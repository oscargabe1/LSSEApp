			Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) invented the
			telephone. In 1876 he patented the first telephone
			that was of any real practical use. In 1874 he
			said:
			<br><br>
			“If I could make a current of electricity vary
			in intensity precisely as the air varies in density
			during the production of sound, I should be able
			to transmit speech telegraphically.” This is the
			principle of the telephone.
			<br><br>
			On March 10, 1876, the first historic message was telephoned to Thomas
			A. Watson, Bell’s assistant. Watson was in another room and received the
			famous message: “Mr. Watson, come here; I want you”.
			<br><br>
			Bell’s first machine gave electrical currents too weak to be of much use
			for the general public. In 1877, the American scientist Thomas A. Edison
			(1847-1931) invented the variable-contact carbon transmitter, which greatly
			increased the power of the signals. The telephone was immediately popular
			in the United States. However, Alexander Graham Bell found little interest
			in Britain when he visited the country in 1878. Then while on his visit, Queen
			Victoria asked for a pair of telephones. Then royal interest resulted in a
			London telephone exchange being formed in 1879 with eight subscribers.
