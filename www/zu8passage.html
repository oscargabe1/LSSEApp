			The Peace Corps was established by President John
			F. Kennedy on March 1, 1961. It became a permanent
			United States government agency under the State
			Department in September of that same year. Its aim,
			in the words of President Kennedy, was to “create
			a pool of trained American men and women sent
			overseas by the United States government to help
			foreign countries meet their need of power.”
			<br><br>
			Volunteers for the Peace Corps must be United States citizens and at least 18 years
			old. An accepted volunteer is assigned to a project requested by a foreign country. The
			volunteer prepares for his task by studying for three months at a United States College
			or University. During this time, the volunteers learn the language, history, politics, and
			customs of the country which they are assigned.
			<br><br>
			When they go overseas, the volunteers work
			directly with the inhabitants of the country. They
			speak the native language, sharing their lives and
			receiving a living allowance comparable to that
			earned by the people among whom they are
			working with. The normal term of service is two
			years. In 1961 about 900 volunteers served in
			sixteen different countries of Latin America, Asia,
			and Africa.
			<br><br>
			The number of volunteers has risen steadily each year. Two years after its formation,
			the Peace Corps won the Ramon Magsaysay Award. The award consists of a $10,000
			dollar prize and is the Asian equivalent to the Nobel Peace Prize. A non-Asian group
			had never before won this award.
