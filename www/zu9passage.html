			The world’s most favorite portrait is the “Mona
			Lisa.” It was painted by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-
			1519) between 1503 and 1506. It hangs in the Louvre
			museum, which formally served as the palace of the
			French King. The Louvre Museum displays priceless
			art treasures and antiques.
			<br><br>
			The Mona Lisa is also called La Gioconda because
			the sitter’s married name was Giocondo. Except
			for two occasions, it has been in France ever since
			1516 when Leonardo da Vinci left Italy to settle in
			France. Once, in 1911, the picture was stolen from
			the Louvre and found two years later in Italy. The
			second time
			it left France for 26 days, in 1960 on a fantastic, well guarded, and highly insured, visit
			to the United States as a guest of President John F. Kennedy.
			<br><br>
			Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa when the young girl was 24 and
			he was 51. She used to come to the great master’s studio in the evening when the light
			was soft. Over the three years, Leonardo became fascinated by his model. Perhaps that
			was the reason why her husband, Francesco del Giocondo, never received the finished
			portrait. The artist always made the excuse that he had not quite finished it. He carried
			it with him whenever he went to Milan, to Rome and finally, to France. Where King
			Francis I offered the artist a palace in the beautiful Loire Valley, the Chateau de Cloux.
			<br><br>
			It is believed that Francis I paid 4,000 gold crowns for the Mona Lisa. However, it was
			not until after Leonardo’s death that the king was able, at last, to possess the painting of
			the Florentine lady with the enigmatic smile. Thereafter, it remained in the possession of
			the kings and emperors of France. The picture hung at Fontainebleau, at Versailles and
			at the Tuileries. Then in 1800 it hung on the wall of Napoleon Bonaparte’s bedroom.
